# Docker based React developing environment

## The first time to run this project after cloning it

As `node_modules/` folder is not exist, you have to change `docker-compose.yml` file to run a basic and none dependent script `app.js`. Then get into the container and run

```shell
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies. Then switch back and run react.
